# Integrations

Alright, you've just setup Oktopus to manage all your multi-vendor devices, hoping it to be a one platform, with one UI to solve all your problems, but then suddenly you realize that you have other systems and software for different purposes but you wish all those solutions to converge into a coesive ecosystem.

For this matter Oktopus provides two alternatives:

### REST API

To integrate Oktopus into your ecosystem, you can rely on [Oktopus Controller REST API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/18932104/2s93eR3vQY). It's documented in Postman, with many usage examples in different programming languages, and lots of possibilities.&#x20;

### NATS

For advanced users who may need real time information and have experience with PUB/SUB messagery concepts, it's also possible to use NATS.

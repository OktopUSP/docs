# Requirements

For small deployments with 10 \~ 50 thousand devices, the standalone mode might be a good deal. If you want to manage more than 50 thousand devices or own a business critical operation, than you should consider to go with the high availability mode.

On real world environments, just to have Oktopus Controller to manage your devices is not enough, you must care about many other components as advanced device configuration, logs, metrics, redundancy, scalabilty,  integration with your core and more. All those components are not addressed into Oktopus Controller Open Source and should be taken in count to have a production-ready environment. To have all of this set, we advice you to rely on experienced professionals, with a good understanding of USP and/or CWMP standards, just as we provide in the [Enterprise Edition.](broken-reference)
